Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) System is an intelligent platform designed to simulate, detect, and predict structural damage using sensor data and machine learning. It leverages vibration, strain, displacement, temperature, and humidity readings to assess the health of structures, providing real-time alerts to support preventive maintenance and enhance safety.

Overview

This project aims to improve structural safety by:

Generating synthetic sensor data representing real-world conditions

Simulating damage risk based on combined sensor metrics

Using machine learning (Random Forest) to classify damage status

Providing visual insights into feature importance for the model

Offering a simple web interface for interaction and real-time damage prediction

Languages Used:

Front End : HTML, CSS
Backend : Python
