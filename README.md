Project Summary
This project simulates a Structural Health Monitoring system that uses sensor data and machine learning to detect potential damage
in structures. By analyzing vibration, strain, displacement, temperature, and humidity data, the system predicts damage risks 
and provides real-time alerts. It helps improve maintenance decisions and prevents structural failures.

Languages Used
